    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Higher Thought EnT is more than a brand—it’s a movement. Rooted in the power of Etymology and the pursuit of Truth, we explore the deep questions of existence through meditation, storytelling, philosophy, and conscious creativity. Thinking higher isn’t just a mindset—it’s a lifestyle. From non-traditional meditation journeys to immersive experiences designed to awaken the soul, our mission is to help you reconnect with your inner wisdom, elevate your awareness, and light the way forward—one thought at a time.

  <section class="symbolism">
    <h2>What the Lightbulb Symbolizes</h2>
    <p>
      Light bulbs symbolize the power to illuminate—ideas, feelings, actions, or truths that shine from a grounded place. They represent sparks of clarity, moments of inspiration, and energy that radiates positivity wherever it flows. At Higher Thought, we believe those sparks are divine breadcrumbs. Embrace the light. Be the light. And follow the light bulbs—they’ll guide you through the darkness and into deeper understanding.
