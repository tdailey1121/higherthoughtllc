    <p class="mission-text">
      <strong>Higher Thought EnT</strong> is more than a brand — it’s a movement. Rooted in the power of <strong>Etymology</strong> and the pursuit of <strong>Truth</strong>, we explore the deep questions of existence through <strong>meditation</strong>, <strong>storytelling</strong>, <strong>philosophy</strong>, and <strong>conscious creativity</strong>.
      Thinking higher isn’t just a mindset — it’s a lifestyle. From non-traditional meditation journeys to immersive experiences designed to <strong>awaken</strong> the soul, our mission is to help you reconnect with your inner wisdom, elevate your awareness, and light the way forward—one thought at a time.
